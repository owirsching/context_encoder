# context_encoder
Context Encoder for Image Inpainting using Pytorch

## Results
Based On: https://github.com/BoyuanJiang/context_encoder_pytorch/tree/master


![Same Masks](single_mask.png)
Inpainting trained on a singular random mask generated by Perlin Noise and tested on the same random mask. After 200 epochs of training. 


![Different Masks](diff_masks.png)
Inpainting trained on on singular random mask generated by Perlin Noise and tested on a circle. After 200 epochs of training. 

As evident from the results above, this system can accomplish image inpainting for art restoration when training on the same mask that is being tested. Results decline when testing on a different mask than what was trained on. 

## How to Run
To Train

`python3 train.py --wtl2 0.999 --niter 200 --cuda`

To Test 

`python3 test.py --netG model/netG_streetview.pth --dataroot dataset/val --batchSize 100`
